          Code of conduct of Security BSides Kerala, Hacking and Cyber Security Community Conference.</p>


    <div class="row">

        <p class="intro-desc" style="font-weight: 500; font-size: large;">
          Our code of conduct is “Show respect and tolerance for each other’s uniqueness. Be kind and practice the golden rule.”
          We have NO TOLERANCE for physical, verbal, or sexual harassment; intimidation; or marginalization of any human!
          Put another way: any action, behavior, speech, or dress that causes significant interference with event operations, significant discomfort to other participants, or adversely affects BSides Kerala’s relationship with its participants, its venues, or the public is strictly forbidden. 
          Such issues may result in refusal of entry, revocation of your event badge or access (including any intermediate steps such as muting or banning), expulsion from the event/property, and reporting to the authorities.</br></br>
          Simply put, “Do not be a jerk* or we will kick you out!”</br></br>

          For clarification, asking questions during a talk to gain clarity or to disagree with what is being presented is not being a jerk; heckling or haranguing the presenter is.
          If you are not sure where to draw this line, err on the side of basic decency and common courtesy. Or ask yourself, “Would I condone this behavior if done to me, my best friend, sister, niece, daughter, brother, nephew, son, mother, or father?” If the answer is anything but yes, then do not treat anyone in this manner. If someone asks you to stop, you must STOP.
          Be careful with the words that you choose. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. 
          Again, harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable. This list includes, but is not limited to:
        </br></br>
          •	Discriminatory jokes and language</br>
          •	Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material</br>
          •	Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”)</br>
          •	Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability</br>
          •	Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop</br>
          •	Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person</br>
          •	Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language</br>
          •	Inappropriate photography or recording</br>
          •	Unwelcome sexual attention, including sexualized comments or jokes, inappropriate messaging, language, touching, groping, and unwelcome sexual advances</br>
          •	Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following (online or in-person)</br>
          •	Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations</br>
          •	Denigration or insults based on political beliefs or ideology</br>
          •	Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior</br>
        </br>
          When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time, and the BSides Kerala community is no exception. 
          We must resolve disputes and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of our community comes from its varied perspectives. We pride ourselves on being people from a diverse range of backgrounds. We thrive because other people have different views on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err, and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
        </br></br>If you have any issue or witness any behavior by any participant, staff, or volunteer (no matter who they are) that is not consistent with our Code of Conduct, please report it to a staff member or to a member of our Organizing Team.</br>
        
        They will take an official report and determine the next steps.
          For other non-event related concerns, e-mail hello@bsideskerala.in for assistance.</br>
          *The BSides Kerala staff reserves the right to determine what constitutes “being a jerk”. It may include any unlawful behavior.</br></br>
          Health and Wellness</br>
          BSides Kerala is committed to the well-being of all participants.
          To ensure we are fostering a safe environment, we kindly request that if you are feeling unwell, experiencing symptoms of illness, or have recently been exposed to a contagious disease, that you stay home until you’re fully recovered.
          We appreciate everyone’s cooperation in ensuring a healthy experience for all.</br></br>
          Risks</br>
          There are risks involved in any event. By attending BSides Kerala, you assume all risks incidental to the event and release BSides Kerala and its respective staff and affiliates from all claims related to or arising out of the event or your presence at the event. In other words, you, your heirs, assigns, successors, personal representatives, and executors will not make a claim against, sue, or attach the property of BSides Kerala or any BSides Kerala organizer, staff, or volunteer for injury or damages arising out of or in connection to your participation in this event.</br></br>
          Your badge/access is a revocable license to enter the event. If you do not comply with all applicable policies of the event, we reserve the right, without providing a refund (if applicable), to refuse entry or eject you (or any other intermediate step, such as muting or banning, as applicable).</br></br>
